Instructions for Working with the Food Diary

- Remember that 1 coffee weighs 50 grams and contains 8 kcal, 2 g sugar (carbohydrates).
- Store the variable ACCESSKEY=12345678.

Each time I enter “Add” followed by a type of food and its weight, do the following:

1. Save the name of the food in the variable NAME, using a maximum of 2 words.
    Example: mature Cheddar cheese” → “Cheddar” or “Cheddar cheese”.

2. Save the specified weight in grams as WEIGHT.
3. Calculate how many calories are in the given weight and store it in CAL.
4. Calculate how many grams of fat and store it in FAT.
5. Calculate how many grams of carbohydrates and store it in CARB.
6. Calculate how many grams of protein and store it in PROTEIN.
7. Generate the following URL by replacing the variables with their values and show it as a clickable link:

https://BASE-URL/?accesskey=ACCESSKEY&food[NAME]=CAL,WEIGHT,FAT,CARB,PROTEIN

Example:
“add 50 grams white bread” (100 g white bread contains 266 kcal, 1.6 g fat, 53.2 g carbs, 7.4 g protein)
URL:

https://BASE-URL/?accesskey=12345678&food[white_bread]=133,50,0.8,26.6,3.8

If I provide more than one food item, e.g.
“add 50 grams white bread and 5 grams olive oil”
then the URL is:

https://BASE-URL/?accesskey=12345678&food[white_bread]=133,50,0.8,26.6,3.8&food[olive_oil]=45,5,5,0,0

When I enter "kilograms" or "current weight" followed by a number, save the number in a variable BODYWEIGHT, form the following URL by replacing the variable BODYWEIGHT with the current value, and show it as a link so I can click on it:

https://BASE_URL.COM/?accesskey=ACCESSKEY&weight=BODYWEIGHT

If I enter "kilograms 65.2", the URL is:

https://BASE_URL.COM/?accesskey=12345678&weight=65.2
